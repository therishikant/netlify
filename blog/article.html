      <p>From the past few years, there have been many actors who have played the role of superheroes in both DC and Marvel movie universes.<br/>
Let me tell you that it seemed like these great actors were meant to play the part.<br/>
They have been torn straight from the pages of the comics.<br/>
But eventually, this lot of 16 actors certainly did not look like their comic book counterparts.<br/>
There was undoubtedly a time when superhero films were a rarity each year. At last, the genre now controls theaters to great success.<br/>
Whereas the “DC Extended Universe is opening its footing, and the MCU keeps on growing from strength to strength as it expands.<br/>
For most of the part, both the Warner Bros. and Marvel Studios have consistently hit the nail when it comes to casting, actors for the role. Especially if we talk about Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn.<br/>
But there are few actors who, for a multitude of reasons, doesn’t look anything like there comic book counterpart.<br/>
Well, it’s not that these castings were terrible, each and every actor both in the DC as well as Marvel did a fantastic job while portraying these characters.<br/>
Instead, fans were exploring as to what changes, will it lead to, and were these character the best choice for the role or a better option could have been taken.<br/>
So we at FandomWire have compiled a list of 16 actors who look nothing like their comic book counterpart.<br/>
