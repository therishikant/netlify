      <p>Cartoon characters are such an essential part of our childhood. While growing up, they often become our heroes for the way they are. However, we weren’t smart enough back then to understand what made them so fun and loveable. Some of our favorite cartoon characters whom we never saw lighting up on the screen, were secret stoners. They were never explicitly shown doing so because of obvious reasons but they 100% radiated the stoner energy.</p>
      <p>Here are 15 cartoon characters who were never seen smoking marijuana, but were most probably stoners:</p>
      <h2>Shaggy from <a href="https://fandomwire.com/10-nerdiest-tv-cameos/"><i>Scooby-Doo</i></a></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Shaggy was seemingly the most prominent stoner on TV. He always had the munchies with him, giggled all the time and even appeared a bit paranoid at times.</p>
      <h2>Scooby from <i>Scooby-Doo</i></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-1.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Shaggy’s sidekick Scooby Doo’s middle name “Doobie” is a synonym for a joint. Just like Shaggy, Scooby was also always down to eat. What do you think was there in those Scooby snacks?</p>
      <h2>Patrick Star from <a href="https://fandomwire.com/spongebob-squarepants/"><i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i></a></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-28.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Patrick spent the majority of his time eating and sleeping. When he wasn’t doing any of that, he would be seen making very stupid observations about the world. Sounds like your stereotypical stoner to me.</p>
      <h2>Crush from <i>Finding Nemo</i></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-29.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Crush the 150-year-old turtle was either high on jellyfishes or was indulging in some of that broccoli. There’s gotta be a reason behind that chill, surfer dude energy.</p>
      <h2>Sheen Estévez from <i>The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron</i></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Sheen radiated very distinct stoner energy. He was silly and always lost in his own imagination.</p>
      <h2>Garfield from <i>Garfield And Friends</i></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/6.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>What does Garfield have in common with stoners? Well, a lot of things. Garfield hated Mondays the most and spent all his time at home eating or sleeping. He definitely has the access to some of that special catnip.</p>
      <h2>Daria Morgendorffer from <i>Daria</i> </h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/7-24.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Daria didn’t ever light it up on her show, but her laissez-faire attitude and lack of interest in all things “popular” make her a prime candidate for cannabis on our list.</p>
      <h2>Ed, Edd and Eddy from <i>Ed, Edd and Eddy</i></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8-26.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There are no chances that these three were weren’t baked on the show. You can already picture how their friendship was deepened from long nights spent smoking together.</p>
      <h2>Beavis and Butthead from <i>Beavis and Butthead</i></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/9-24.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>From their odd giggles to their strange antics, the makers gave it away evidently that Beavis and Butthead were both potheads.</p>
      <h2>Grandpa Phil from <i>Hey Arnold!</i></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-24.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Grandpa Phil from <i>Hey Arnold! </i>was a pretty strange dude. He often made remarks about losing his brain cells back in his youth and apparently grew up in Woodstock.</p>
      <h2>Michelangelo from <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </i></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-21.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Michelangelo’s voice gave it away for him. He was always craving pizza and had the most laidback attitude with a child-like mentality. </p>
      <h2>Brian from <i>Family Guy</i></h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://fandomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-20.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Brian has frequently talked about his experiences with weed. It may seem strange for a dog to smoke weed, but nothing surprises us anymore. With Peter as your owner, what else can you expect.</p>
      <h2>Speedy Gonzales from <i>Looney Tunes</i></h2>
      <p>Here’s speedy singing “La Cucaracha”, and not missing a beat of the lyric which translates to: “The roach, the roach, can not walk any more. Because it needs, because it needs, marijuana to smoke.”</p>
